## Hi there 👋

I am Yuvia, a genomicist from Mexico City with 13+ years of experience in the field of gene regulation and the analysis of next-generation sequencing data.

I studied genomic sciences at the UNAM in Mexico and then continued my graduate studies in life sciences at the ENS and Sorbonne Université in France.

As part of my postdoctoral research project, I worked in the development of pipelines for the processing of multiple types of functional genomics sequencing data, such as ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and CUT&RUN. During the last years, I have gained experienced in the biotech sector, supporting companies with the analysis of genomics data to de-risk CRISPR/Cas9 editing approaches, identify cancer targets and clarify mechanisms of action.

I am a lifelong learner 🤓 always looking to improve my R and python skills and currently gaining knowledge in machine learning.

Besides the quality time that I spend with my PC, I like to:

- fill my sketchbooks and paint 🎨
- do gardening 🌱 
- take care of my zebrafish 🐠🐠🐠
- learn languages 📚 ✈️
