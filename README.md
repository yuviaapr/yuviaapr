## Hi there 👋

I am Yuvia, a genomicist from Mexico City with 10+ years of experience in the field of gene regulation and the analysis of next-generation sequencing data.

I studied genomic sciences at the UNAM in Mexico and then continued my graduate studies in life sciences at the ENS and Sorbonne Université in France.

As part of my current research project, I work in the development of pipelines for the processing of multiple types of functional genomics sequencing data, such as ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and CUT&RUN.

I am a lifelong learner 🤓 always looking to improve my R and python skills and currently gaining knowledge in machine learning.

Besides the quality time that I spend with my PC, I like to:

- fill my sketchbooks and paint 🎨
- do gardening 🌱 
- take care of my zebrafish 🐠🐠🐠
- learn languages 📚 ✈️
